/*
*   Possible approach:
*       1. From the first index, check if the next integer is greater than the current one.
*       2. If yes, increment the counter by 1 and do the same at the next index.
*       3. If no, compare the new length of the subsequence with the last one and start from the next index to *          examine the other lengths
